# Cryptoparty Ann Arbor Pages

This will be the github pages repo for cryptoparty ann arbor.

This lets us have a web presence besides cryptoparty.in, which gives us:
1) redundant way to disseminate info
2) greater control over website
3) minimal cost hosting+maintenance
4) ability to use awesome a2crypto.party url

## Jekyll

This uses Jekyll so things look nice and are easy to manage. To
get started with Jekyll, just check out the 
[github pages quick guide](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/).
Another good resource is the [jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).

### Making a Post

Posts go in the `_posts` directory, and should follow the `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext`
filename convention. They also require 'front-matter'; metadata at
the top of the markdown file.

## Change/Development Process

Just to keep things sane, we'll try to follow a development process
that mirrors typical software development. The `master` branch will be
production; never directly touch it. Instead, do your work for
a post in a [feature branch](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow), which should be in your own fork of the repo.
For example, if you're writing a post about FreeNet, you can make a branch
called `2016-Jan-freenet-design-overview` in your repo and write away.
Once you feel the work is ready for the world, make sure it's pushed to
your github repo, and open a pull request to `master`.
We've still got to verify pull requests work as expected, but the idea
is to get multiple eyes on a post to 'approve' it before publishing.
This will catch silly typos and technical errors, as well as prevent
any single person from being able to do anything too silly to the blog.

This development process also is not set in stone, so feel free to make
suggestions/criticisms.
