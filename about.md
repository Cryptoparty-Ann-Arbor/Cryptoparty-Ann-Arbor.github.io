Cryptoparty Ann Arbor is a community of privacy-minded educators, techies, and enthusiasts
working to help you reclaim your privacy. We educate the public on how privacy
is impacted in the digital age, and how they can better protect themselves. Freely offering
informal training and assistance, we want to empower you to more fully live your life as you see fit.
We put people first, and see within technology the potential for liberatory social change.
