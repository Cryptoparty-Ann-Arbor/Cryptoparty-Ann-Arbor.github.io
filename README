# Cryptoparty Ann Arbor Pages

This will be the github pages repo for cryptoparty ann arbor.

This lets us have a web presence besides cryptoparty.in, which gives us:
1) redundant way to disseminate info
2) greater control over website
3) minimal cost hosting+maintenance
4) ability to use awesome a2crypto.party url

## Jekyll
