## Tor Hack Day!

Sunday October 2nd, 1pm, [All Hands Active][aha], 255 E Liberty, Suite 225 (Lower Level)

In solidarity with the official Tor Project, we'll be having a Tor
hack day! The goal is to collectively learn about, work on, and
experiment with tor and everything tor-related on a deeper level
than the usual cryptoparties provide. As usual, all are welcome!
Bring a laptop and a friend!
