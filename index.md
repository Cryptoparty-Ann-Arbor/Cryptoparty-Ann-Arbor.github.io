## About

Cryptoparty Ann Arbor is a community of privacy-minded educators, techies, activists, and enthusiasts working to help you reclaim your privacy.
We put people first, and see within technology the potential for liberatory social change.

## What we do
* Educate public on privacy issues in the digital age.
* Informal training and assistance to empower people to live their lives as they see fit.
* Fight back against privacy intrusions, from greedy corporations to nosey government bureaus.

## Electronic Frontier Alliance
As a member organization of the [Electronic Frontier Alliance](https://eff.org/efa), we believe that technology should support the intellectual freedom at the heart of a democratic society. In the digital age, that entails advancing:
1. Free Expression: People should be able to speak their minds to whoever will listen.
2. Security: Technology should be trustworthy and answer to its users.
3. Privacy: Technology should allow private and anonymous speech, and allow users to set their own parameters about what to share with whom.
4. Creativity: Technology should promote progress by allowing people to build on the ideas, creations, and inventions of others. 
5. Access to Knowledge: Curiosity should be rewarded, not stifled.

We uphold these principles by fighting for transparency and freedom in culture, code, and law.  

## Getting Involved
Whether you're simply curious or want to start a technical revolution, we encourage you to get in touch with us physically or electronically.
The only time conditions change is when we band together to change them.
