Cryptoparty Ann Arbor is a community of privacy-minded educators, techies, activists, and enthusiasts working to help you reclaim your privacy.
We put people first, and see within technology the potential for liberatory social change.

## What we do
* Educate public on privacy issues in the digital age.
* Informal training and assistance to empower people to live their lives as they see fit.
* Fight back against privacy intrusions, from greedy corporations to nosey government bureaus.

## Getting Involved
Whether you're simply curious or want to start a technical revolution, we encourage you to get in touch with us physically or electronically.
The only time conditions change is when we band together to change them.

We hold monthly meetings, open to the public and free for all. This is a great opportunity to
learn about privacy technology, meet other like-minded people, brainstorm new systems and discuss
current issues and events.

Meetings are every 2nd Saturday of the month at 4pm in [All Hands Active](http://www.allhandsactive.org/), at
