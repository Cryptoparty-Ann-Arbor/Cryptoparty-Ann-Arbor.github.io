Cryptoparty Ann Arbor is a community of privacy-minded educators, techies, activists, and enthusiasts working to help you reclaim your privacy.
We put people first, and see within technology the potential for liberatory social change.

## What we do
* Educate public on privacy issues in the digital age.
* Informal training and assistance to empower people to live their lives as they see fit.
* Fight back against privacy intrusions, from greedy corporations to nosey government bureaus.

## Getting Involved
Whether you're simply curious or want to start a technical revolution, we encourage you to get in touch with us physically or electronically.
The only time conditions change is when we band together to change them.
