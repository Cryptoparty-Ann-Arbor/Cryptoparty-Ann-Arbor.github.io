Cryptoparty Ann Arbor is a community of privacy-minded educators, techies, activists, and enthusiasts working to help you reclaim your privacy.
We put people first, and see within technology the potential for liberatory social change.

## Cryptoparty is all about:
* Educating the public on privacy issues in the digital age.
* Informal training and assistance to empower people to live their lives as they see fit.
* Fighting back against privacy intrusions, from greedy corporations to nosey government bureaus.

Whether you're simply curious or want to start a technical revolution, we encourage you to get in touch with us physically or electronically.
