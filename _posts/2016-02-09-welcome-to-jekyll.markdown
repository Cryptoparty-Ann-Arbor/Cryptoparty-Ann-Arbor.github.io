Hello and welcome to Cryptoparty Ann Arbor!

Since 2015 we've been holding monthly cryptoparties and special events to educate the public on how their privacy
is impacted in the digital age, and how they can better protect themselves. If you care about your
privacy, have your own advice you'd like to share, or are simply curious, we encourage you to attend
a meeting!

Monthly meetings are currently held every 2nd Saturday of the month, at 4pm in [All Hands Active][aha],
Ann Arbor's premier downtown hackerspace/makerspace. Meetings are entirely free and open to the public,
so bring a laptop and a friend!
